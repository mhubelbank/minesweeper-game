## README
#### Authored by user @mhubelbank.

This repo contains the source code and gameplay screenshots of a Java graphics-based Minesweeper replica. I wrote this code during my freshman year at Northeastern University; as with my [2048 game](https://github.com/mhubelbank/2048-game) replica, it thus lacks the application of object-oriented design principles and algorithms which I learned shortly thereafter.

For my most recent game implementation project, which uses the model-view-controller design pattern, SOLID design principles, and JUnit testing framework, see [Pyramid Solitaire](https://github.com/mhubelbank/pyramid-solitaire-game).
